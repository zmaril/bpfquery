Here is what I am aiming for for v1 of bpfquery:


Based on feedback and more thinking and testing 


mspc r

realtime ui like viewview 
joins streams

streams
snapshots 
tables 
sqlite to start
maybe duckdb if it makes sense someday 

not acid or consistent 
bpf maps pushdown 

bpftrace just pulls iyn data

datafusion aal arroyo for query engine 

websites fumadocs

ospquery and bpf
bpfquery /engine /website 
crashcart for interesting ui 

websockets for engine contiuns 
repl for dev 

multiplex queries
multiplexsources 
for performance 

bindings 

use kfuncs by default 
use a.b.c.d.1.seconds or 1.rows for time or count
